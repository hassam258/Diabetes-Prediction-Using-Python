# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Python
**BUSINESSUNDERSTANDING**
**Background**
Diabetes is a very common and prevalent disease, where either too little or no 
insulin is produced by pancreas. Low level of insulin makes body unable to 
metabolize sugar/glucose, which results in higher glucose level in blood also 
known as hyperglycemia which can lead to many other health problems affecting 
our body system.
**Problem Description**
Number of Diabetic patients is increasing worldwide. One out of ten people are 
suffering from diabetes. If this disease is not diagnosed on time, then it can 
increase the risk of stroke, neuropathy and many other complications such as 
vision loss and cardiovascular diseases. These complications can adversely effect 
one’s life. Hence, early detection of this disease necessary for maintaining a 
healthy life. There are various factors for developing this very disease like blood 
pressure, body weight and food habits etc.
**Objective**
Our objective is to build effective predictive models from the given data which can 
identify patients at risk of having diabetes. Moreover, we will predict diabetes with 
the help of significant attributes. For our models, we will use patients’ data and 
laboratory results will be used for making above predictions which includes 
patient’s BMI, Blood pressure, age, Gender, etc.
**Motivation**
There is a need of diabetes or any risk predictors for making decisions in clinical 
managements of patients so that the risk of developing diseases can be reduced and
treatments can be initiated. Using these models, physicians can predict the future 
assurance of this very disease and can prevent it.
**DATA DESCRIPTION**
For this project, I collected data from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicatorsdataset?select=diabetes_binary_5050split_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv
Our dataset consists of 70,629 records each having 21 features. Some features have
categorical data, and some have continuous data. These features are: High BP,
BMI, High Cholesterol, Heart diseases, Heavy alcohol consumption, General
health, mental health, physical health, age, gender and few more.
A brief overview of our data is as below:
❖ HighBP: High Blood pressure of the person
❖ HighChol: A person having higher blood cholesterol
❖ BMI: Body Mass Index(BMI) of the person
❖ Smoker: whether the person has smoked in his/her entire life
❖ Stroke: Patients ever had a stroke
❖ HeartDiseaseorAttack: Whether the person has ever reported having any 
heart disease
❖ PhysActivity : Those who are doing exercise and other physical activities
❖ HvyAlcoholConsump; People consuming Alcohol or heavy drinks
❖ GenHlth: Mealth of the person in general
❖ Fruits: Is the person eating fruits or not?
❖ Veggies: Is the person consuming vegetables in a day or not?
❖ AnyHealthcare: Any kind of health care coverage like health insurance or 
any other Government plans.
❖ MentHlth: Mental health of the person. Whether a person is anxiety and 
Depression or not
❖ PhysHlth: Person having Good physical heath or not?
❖ DiffWalk: Does the face difficulty while walking or climbing?
❖ Sex: gender of the patient
❖ Age: Age of the person/patient
❖ Education: Qualification of the patient
❖ Income: Household income of the person
